## Assignment

_(It is not required to write any new code for this assignment. You are welcome to run one or more of the provided examples with your own data. You can document the results in a blog post (or link to a web page where the text is generated). I'll include some other ideas below in case you are feeling ambitious.)_

Invent your own grammar and generate text. I suggest using [Tracery](http://tracery.io/) but [you can base your code on any of my examples](https://editor.p5js.org/a2zitp/collections/5IFiJuQZa), try [RiGrammer](https://rednoise.org/rita/reference/RiTa/grammar/index.html) from the RiTa library, use [ContextFree GenGen](http://cfgg.decontextualize.com) with a Google Sheet (_not working_ 😢), or even investigate Allison Parrish's [Seaduck](https://github.com/aparrish/seaduck).

Getting results from a context-free-grammar can be tricky. Short and sweet, highly structured ideas tend to work well. For example.

- A coffee drink order generator.
- An apology generator.
- An ITP project idea generator.
- A knock knock joke generator.

Something you might consider is pulling the "terminal" words for your grammar from an API or other data source. You are also welcome to explore generative visual art with Context Free Grammars basing your exercise off of the L-System material described above. Or what else can you generate from a Context-Free Grammar? Music?
