# Final Projects

Your final project is a three-ish week assignment to be completed in two stages (proposal and implementation). Proposals will be presented in class on November 17 and 24 - [proposal presentation schedule and guidelines](proposals.md)! Final presentations will be December 8 - [final presentation schedule and guidelines](documentation.md)

The final project should be a creative project that builds off or is inspired by the concepts we've covered this semester. You should feel free to think non-traditionally, projects do not need to be screen-based and there is no requirement to use a particular aspect of JavaScript or programming.

Final projects can be collaborations with anyone in any class. Final projects can be one part of a larger project integrated with a different class.

Other notes:

1. Keeping things simple and small in scope is a plus. If your project idea is a big one, consider documenting the larger idea but implementing just a small piece of it.
2. Also think about making a final project for a small audience, even one single person like a family member or friend. . . or yourself. This can be a good way to focus your idea and design process. "Generalizing" the idea can come later (or maybe not at all.)

## Project Development and Testing

The testing will follow a speed "round robin" format. The class will be divided into two groups and we'll do two rounds. For each round half the students will set up on a laptop in the class room and the other half will "view" or "interact with" or "listen to" your project for ~5-7 minutes. We'll rotate so that all "testers" will try each project and provide feedback.

This can mean something different for different projects. For an interactive web application, a link to a rough prototype is ideal. For a physical installation or performance or twitter bot, you might need to get creative. If you are not sure how to design your testing, e-mail me and we'll discuss. The "rule" that we will try to adhere to is no explaining of the project until after the user has viewed/interacted.

If you are not sure how to design your testing, e-mail me and we'll discuss.
